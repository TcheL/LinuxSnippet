## Description

There are some useful snippets for Linux-user in [the repository](https://github.com/TcheL/LinuxSnips). Sometime on Linux, I have to write some scripts by myself for my work. Now, I recast the scripts as these snippets for general purpose, and hope to help your Linux work.

Based on the differences of the function of snippets and script type, I put the snippets under the different directories:

- **shell**: the snippets for shell script.
- **make**: the snippets/templates of makefile for project compiling.
